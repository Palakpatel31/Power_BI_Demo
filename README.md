# Power_BI_Demo
A repository containing a Power BI project leveraging the "global_superstore_2016" dataset, showcasing visualizations and 
insights derived from the data for global sales analysis and forecasting.

I have developed a demo Power BI dashboard using the "global_superstore_2016" dataset, sourced from the internet. 
The dataset consists of three sheets: 'Orders', 'People', and 'Returns' in CSV format. By uploading the CSV file to Power BI, 
I was able to gain insights from the data. Utilizing the power of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), I made necessary modifications 
to the data and established relationships among the sheets in the model tab. This allowed me to effectively analyze and visualize 
the data, presenting key findings and patterns through the Power BI dashboard.
